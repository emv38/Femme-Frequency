                    "ArtRevi's 2018 Power 100 list of the “most influential people in the contemporary art world” included 40% women—a slight improvement from 2017 (38%) and 2016 (32%)". <a href="#" target="_blank">(Review)</a> 
                    </br></br>
                    "The NEA found that as women artists age, they earn progressively less than their male artist counterparts. Women artists aged 55-64 earn only 66¢ for each $1 earned by men." <a href="https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/publications/artists-and-other-cultural-workers-statistical-portrait" target="_blank">(National Endowment for the Arts)</a>
                    </br></br>
                    Women and feminine bodies have been creating and producing art since the beginning of time. It's time we start paying attention.
