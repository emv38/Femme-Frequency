                    ArtRevi's 2018 Power 100 list of the “most influential people in the contemporary art world” included 40% women—a slight improvement from 2017 (38%) and 2016 (32%). <a href="https://aamd.org/our-members/from-the-field/gender-gap-report-2017" target="_blank">(Review)</a>

                    The NEA found that as women artists age, they earn progressively less than their male artist counterparts. Women artists aged 55-64 earn only 66¢ for each $1 earned by men. <a href="https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/publications/artists-and-other-cultural-workers-statistical-portrait" target="_blank">(National Endowment for the Arts)</a>
